# June 25th: Brainstorming and coming up with ideas

- Wanted to do something similar to my other project which was a wifi servo controlled model rocket
- And wanted to do somethign that flies so this is perfect
- Thinking of using a ESP32 - CAM
- 3.7V Lithium Ion battery
- Micro Servo (Probably SG90)
- Servo Driver Board
- Motor + propeller
- 3.7v to 5v boost
- This should hopefully be it with maybe the addition of LED lights
- Plannign for this to be a 4 point project for now

**Total time spent: 1.5h**
